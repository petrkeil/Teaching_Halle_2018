# Mainland species-area curves are tri-phasic

When area is large enough, it will inevitably start to ovelap **biome boundaries**
and **continental boundaries**, and the curve goes up.

# Can we use the SAR to **estimate global (gamma) diversity**?

- We definitely can't use the Chao or rarefaction-based techniques.

- The theory of the large-scale SAR is still underdeveloped.

- Maybe, we can try to figure it out today!



# Other ways to estimate global richness

There are ways to estimate global biodiversity that are not based on extrapolation
of SAR.

## Extrapolation of temporal scaling (species-time curves)

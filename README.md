# Macroecological patterns


## Morning 10:00-12:00

### Quick overview of large-scale patterns -- 20 min
- History - Humboldt, Wallace
- Gradients: Latitudinal, altitudinal gradients, mid-domain effect
- First law of biogeography -- distance decay
- Species-abundance and range-size distributions
- Abundance-occupancy relationship
- Occupancy-area relationship
- Species-area relationship

### Range size, occupancy, aggregation -- 30 min
- Occupancy-area (OAR)
-- Determining range size, rarity, conservation
-- Inferring process from pattern
-- Extrapolation, interpolation
- Random patterns vs. aggregated pattern
- Fractals


### R exercise -- 1 hour
- Types of data that we work with  -- points, polygons, rasters
http://www.petrkeil.com/?p=648
- Convert species distributions to grids, packages
- Propose a gridding/sampling algorithm -- looping and non-looping solution
- Determine range size of some species
-- Convex hull
-- Box counting, OAR
- Genreate a fractal pattern

## Afternoon 13:00-16:00

### R exercise -- 1 hour

Here we continue the work from morning.

### Species-area relationship -- 30 min

- Theory of SAR and its links to OAR

### R exercise -- 1 hour +

- Estimate global richness at multiple taxa
- Estimate number of plant individuals in the UK

```

# Objective

Your objectives are: 

- Calculate and plot relationship between area of a raster
cell, and range size of the Eurasian beaver.

- Try to do this using both the rasterized polygon, and rasterized point data. Compare the curves.

# Useful packages, functions, hints

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(raster) # handles raster data
library(rgdal)  # handles geographic projections and data import
```

Potentially **useful functions**: `aggregate`

# Data

Use the same beaver data as in Task 1.
